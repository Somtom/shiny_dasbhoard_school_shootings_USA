# 22 

... the number of school shootings which took place in USA within the first 21 weeks 2018.
Statistically this means that **there have been more than 1 shooting per week.**
The [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/05/18/2018-has-been-deadlier-for-schoolchildren-than-service-members/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.9ef6aff4ac6d) writes that this led
to more deaths at schools than deahts of members of the US military while beeing deployed. 
After almost everyone of theses shootings a new discussion about the USA gun laws arrises. 
Nevertheless, I do not want to get into theses discussions but rather do something different:   

In the end, hidden behind all these statistics there are people. People who died, people who got
injuried, people who have been crying for their friends and family members and even more. My aim
was to built a dashboard where one could explore the stories and data behind incidents documented
in the List of a Wikipedia article about  [School Shootings in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_school_shootings_in_the_United_States).

For those who are not interessted in the data cleaning and preparation process, the dashboard
can be found over here: 
[R-Shiny USA School Shootings Dasbhoard](https://somtom.shinyapps.io/usa_school_shootings_shiny/)

The code for the dasbhoard can be found on my Github account:

# Load Data from Wikipedia 

```{r}
url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_school_shootings_in_the_United_States"

# Read html tables and save them to a list
table_list <- url %>% 
  read_html() %>% 
  html_nodes("table") %>% 
  html_table()

# Convert all columns to character to avoid errors becauso of unclean data when binding rows
dt <- map(table_list, function(x) map(x,as.character)) %>% 
  bind_rows()

saveRDS(dt, "./usa_school_shootings_shiny/data/raw.RDS")

head(dt)
```

# Data preparation
## Data Cleaning

* Remove duplicate part of `Date`   
* Remove dublicated `Location` after "!"-character 
* Convert `Injuries` and `Deaths` to integer (characters like "?", "1+", will be converted to NA)

```{r}
dt <- dt %>% 
  mutate(
    # If Date contains "-0000" then remove the first part from it (first 24 characters)
    Date = ifelse(str_detect(Date, "-0000"), 
                  str_sub(Date, 24),
                  Date),
    # Convert Date to Date type
    Date = parse_date(Date, format = "%B %d, %Y", locale = locale("en")),
    year = as.integer(format(Date, "%Y")),
    century = as.integer(format(Date, "%C")),
    decade = floor(year/10)*10,
    # If Location contains "!", then remove part after that character
    Location = ifelse(str_detect(Location, "!"),
                      str_sub(Location, 1, str_locate(Location, " !")[,1] - 1),
                      Location),
    # Count words in Location for correct State extraction
    words_in_location = str_count(Location, '\\w+'),
    # Extract State from Location variable --------------------------------------------------------
    # If City provided (words_in_location > 1), split City and State to only get State
    State = ifelse(words_in_location > 1,
                   str_split_fixed(Location, ",", n = 2)[,2],
                   Location),
    # Trim whitespace and remove "." from abbreviations
    State = gsub("\\.", "", trimws(State)),
    # Correct state abbreviations using the R state.abb and state.name dataset
    State = ifelse(State %in% state.abb,
                   state.name[match(State, state.abb)],
                   State),
    # Convert Deaths and Injuries to integer
    # End: Extract State from Location variable ---------------------------------------------------
    Deaths = as.integer(Deaths),
    Injuries = as.integer(Injuries),
    # Create html popup message for later plot
    popup = paste0("<b>Date: ", Date, "</b><br/>",
                   "<b>Deaths: ", Deaths, "</b><br/>",
                   "<b>Injuries: ", Injuries,"</b><br/>",
                   "<br/>",
                   "<b>Description: </b><br/>",
                   Description)
  ) %>% 
  select(-words_in_location)

dt
```

## Geocoding

```{r}
api_key <- read_lines("./api-key.txt") #you would need to insert your api key here
register_google(api_key, account_type = "standard")
```

```{r, message=F}
# Get location from Google Maps Geocoding API
garbadge <- capture.output(locations <- geocode(dt$Location, messaging = FALSE))

# add latitude and longitude data to our data frame
dt <- bind_cols(dt, locations)

saveRDS(dt, "./usa_school_shootings_shiny/data/cleaned.RDS")
```



# Leaflet map
```{r}
leaflet(data = dt) %>%
  addTiles() %>% 
  addCircleMarkers(lng = ~lon, lat = ~lat, popup = ~popup,
             label = ~Location,
             color = ifelse(dt$Deaths > 0, "red", "blue")
             )

```
